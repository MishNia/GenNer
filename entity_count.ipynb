High plasma fibrinogen levels predispose to hypercoagulability and thrombotic processes. Furthermore, rheological mechanisms, interfering with cell-to-cell contacts, and fluid-dynamic factors, facilitate local endothelial lesions resulting in atherosclerosis. Plasma fibrinogen, as the major contributing factor to plasma viscosity and red-blood-cell aggregation can limit oxygen supply and blood flow in microcirculation even in the absence of apparent coronary artery disease. Pharmacological interventions, in order to decrease elevated fibrinogen levels, do improve myocardial ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease.\",\n          \"/*\\nCopyright The Kubernetes Authors.\\n\\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \\\"License\\\");\\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\\n\\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\\n\\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \\\"AS IS\\\" BASIS,\\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\\nlimitations under the License.\\n*/\\n\\n// Code generated by client-gen.

To the believers though, this holy month holds a much larger significance. It is a period of spiritual cleansing \\u2013 of selfdenial and abstinence, of introspection and above all, a reaffirmation of self-surrender to the will of the Almighty. It was on this month, in 610 A.D., that the prophet Mohammed had experienced his \\u201cdivine revelations\\u201d which went on to form the essential text of the Holy Koran. Ramzan celebrates that event every year with the sighting of the crescent moon \\u2013 the month lasting for 29 or 30 days, depending upon the lunar cycle. Ramzan is also the time for communal bonding and strengthening fraternal ties. Much as the community fasts between sunrise and sunset, food constitutes a star attraction in the daily ritual, should the popularity of iftaar parties these days provide any indication. While politicians and business barons might strike deals over lavish spreads of malpuas and haleem, the more modest and humble would gather with the family around dinner tables to savour an array of biryani preparations, not to mention sumptuous snacks ranging from keema samosas to kababs and chana bhatura. Amidst these, the humble date occupies pride of place. While many might crunch the fruit in its natural or unadorned state, others would have it packed with almonds, soaked in rose water or perhaps, wrapped in fluorescent cellophane. Then there are always those tall glasses of faluda, fruit juice and radiant heaps of pomegranate, oranges and watermelon \\u2013 all peeled and mildly chilled. Indeed, on no other occasion, would these sherbets taste as delicious and refreshing as in the month of Ramzan. Take a walk down Mumbai\\u2019s Mohammad Ali Road after sunset \\u2013 or say, Delhi\\u2019s Chandni Chowk, even the area around Kolkata\\u2019s Nakhoda Masjid. These are busy thoroughfares, which bear a business- like order urgency during the day. But by nightfall, during Ramzan, the very same streets are transformed into a fairyland of bright lights and clattering pans, suffused with the heady aroma of mutton biryani, murg mussalam, malpuas, crunchy mughlais, sheer kurma, tikka\\u2026 It is then that you realize that Muslims in India are determined to crown their month of fasting with more than a little bout of feasting. And whoever heard of disturbing concepts like cholesterol and calorie counts in a culture that boasts of rich tradition of royal cuisine! Another fast emerging trend is that these iftaar binges are not restricted to Muslims only. Non-Muslims are increasingly partaking in these power-packed delicacies, some deliberately fasting during the day so as not to miss out on the variety. In that respect, Ramzan has already emerged from the \\u2018purdah\\u2019 and is acquiring secular overtones, much like Diwali and Dussehra. Political parties have been quick to recognise the mileage to be gained from this \\u201cbonding with biryani\\u201d and are hosting iftaar parties for all communities these days. In all this, what escapes attention is the behind-thescenesvpreparation for the grand occasion. For months before Ramzan, housewives would sun the dry fruits, go around town for the condiments and flavors, grind the masala, roast them and so on. Good Sheer kurma for a gastronome could take up to ten days of hard work before this divine mixture of vermicelli, milk, nuts and dry fruit is cooked right. And then, there is no one way of cooking this dish \\u2013 equivalent to what plum cake is on Christmas or modak is on Ganesh Chaturthi. Every Muslim family has its own recipe for sheer kurma it would not easily part with. But everybody is welcome to it and many foodies make it a point to visit one another over the evenings, only to drink vast quantities of this delicacy. Moreover, within the community, different sects have their own culinary preferences during the festival. So while the north Indian Khans might freak out on kheer, Muslims from Kolkata would go all out for laddoos made of vermicelli. Many Bohra households in Mumbai prefer to dole out chocolates while for others, it could be marzipans. After all, barring dates, which is considered \\u201csunnah\\u201d (auspicious), there is no religious binding on what should be served at the end of every day of rigorous fasting.\\n\\nMaintaining that education holds key in all round development, Minister for school education, Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed, on Sunday said that coalition government is determined to universalize education in the state.\\n\\nThe Minister was addressing Education Conference of Anantnag and Kulgam districts held at Khanabal Anantnag. He said sufficient funds are being provided by the Centre under education sector and several flagship programmes initiated by the centre in this sector have been instrumental in leading country towards cent percent literacy, adding that Jammu and Kashmir is also fast marching towards this direction.\\n\\nThe Minister said that the education should be kept away from politics and no interference should be allowed in educational programmes so that the aims and objectives of imparting education to the new generations are fulfilled.\\n\\nStressing for inculcating moral education among the students, the Minister asked the teaching fraternity to give important lessons on prayer meeting every morning on the opening of schools.\\n\\nResponding to the demands put forth by the organizers, Peerzada announced that confirmation orders of Zonal Education officers would be issued shortly.\\n\\nReferring to the Education conference, the Education Minister hoped that fruitful results would evolve out of the Conference and will help in implementation of related schemes.\\n\\nOn the occasion, Commissioner/Secretary, Education, Naseem Lankar stressed for monitoring of execution of school buildings and judicious use of funds. She also stressed for ensuring quality education to the students.\\n\\nDirector School Education, Kashmir, Sheikh Mushtaq Ahmad in his address highlighted the achievements of the department. He directed the field functionaries to work with missionary zeal and in a true spirit. He asked the concerned to implement the instructions issued by the department about conduct of tour diaries. He asked them to work with utmost dedication and try to show results in implementing the various interventions.\\n\\nDistrict Development Commissioner, Anantnag Kifayat Hussain Rizvi in his address enlightened the rights and duties of teaching fraternity.\\n\\nProject Director, SSA Yasha Mudgal also spoke on the occasion and highlighted the achievements of SSA.\\n\\nChief Education Officers of Anantnag and Kulgam, Principal DIETs, Principals of Higher Secondary of District Anantnag and Kulgam, Zonal Education Officers and Head Masters of Anantnag and Kulgam districts attended the conference.\\n\\n\\u2018It is my kingdom and I am the ruler\\u2019 the kind of attitude that most heads and directors of various departments across the Kashmir University do have. They do have a mindset that whole of the department or center they are heading is their kingdom, the employees working under them are their subjects and they have every right to use them for their personal growth, home chores; incase of any resistance the person is abused to core.\\n\\nThere have been many cases in the varsity where heads have gone to all possible extent to bow down \\u2018resistant subjects\\u2019 so as to set examples for others not to resist and to be loyal to the kings of times.\\n\\nWell, it could sensed, the moment an outsider talks to these \\u2018top academicians\\u2019 of the university all he/she would hear: \\\"I, Me and Myself\\\" who seem to have ostracized in their egos.\\n\\nAnd most a time they would brag about their achievement much more than their actual worth. However, in their cocooned lives they think others are interested in hearing them without realizing that they are annoying and obviously irking someone.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the permanent staff, they too are subjects, but the level of acceptance of orders from the king is least. However, the adhocs, contractual employees are the worst suffers being the \\u2018third class\\u2019 subjects of the var-sity they have to bear the brunt of their kings.\\n\\nIn case of the contractual employees, it is the heads or directors of that department who decides their fate for each day. And the \\u2018kings\\u2019 to best of their abilities use, abuse and reuse them in whatever way they can. Irony is that no one in the varsity is bothered about it. It is not that that those who are at the helm of affairs at top are unaware of these facts but they are putting a blind eye toward this menace.\\n\\nInterestingly, about each other \\u2018lead academicians\\u2019 of the varsity would share all the scorns you probably would ever have heard of. This speaks volumes about their level of maturity they do possess. All that could be suggested to all of them is please realize that those \\u201cI, me and myself\\u201d syndrome is plainly egoist and suffering from a vaunted.\\n\\nMinister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh today flagged off a motorbike expedition to Ladakh.\\n\\nThe expedition\\u2014Peaks of Friendship\\u2014is being sponsored by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country\\u2019s largest oil marketing firm.\\n\\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr Singh appreciated the efforts of the Pathfinders, the organisers, in embarking on an expedition which promises to make a difference to the people living in remote areas.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that Indian Oil, the leader in the downstream petroleum sector is sponsoring this expedition is a proof and an eloquent testimony to our commitment to people living in remote locations,\\\" the Minister said.\\n\\nIOC has been sponsoring the expedition since the year 1995, IOC Chairman R S Butola said, adding it will continue to extend its support in the future as well.\\n\\nIOC Director (HR) Sudhir Bhalla was also present at the flag off ceremony.\\n\\nPilgrimage to holy cave shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi ji was, for the first time, touching 6 million in just seven months of the year recording an increase of 7.77 lakh over the corresponding months last year. The present trend of increase could take the yatra very close to magic figure of 1 crore this year.\\n\\nIt would be the first shrine, located between the Trikuta hills and untouched by the passenger vehicles, to receive nearly 10 million pilgrims in a year in the country.\\n\\nDuring first seven months of this year, 58.63 lakh yatris had visited the cave shrine of Goddess Vaishno Devi, located at a height of 5200 feet from sea level.

The pilgrims had to trek 13 kilometers hilly track from Katra to reach the Bhawan of Goddess Vaishno Devi.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Shrine Board has received report from IIM Ahmedabad experts on yatra management at Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan in view of ever increasing rush of the yatris. The Board had hired services of IIM Ahmedabad experts to suggest yatra management within limited scope of widening at Bhawan complex for better management of yatra queues to ensure that the pilgrims face less inconvenience and time in the queues.\\n\\nThe Shrine Board authorities are studying the report, official sources said.\\n\\nSDPO Katra P N Tickoo said security arrangements at Katra, which serves as base camp for the shrine, Darshani Deodi, Ban Ganga and surrounding areas of Katra have already been intensified in view of unabated heavy rush of the pilgrims to Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan.\\n\\nMr Tickoo said the pilgrims having mobile handset with IMEI number and photo identity cards were being allowed only in the hotels, guest houses, lodges and sarais as per the directive of police.\\n\\nAs against 87.2 lakh yatra in 2010, the number in 2009 was 82 lakh.

The demonstration was led by senior KP leader and president, All State Kashmiri Pandit Conference, (ASKPC) A N Vaishnavi.\\n\\nThe protestors displaying pla-cards and banners raised slogans denouncing the Indo-Pak talks as sham. They said that these talks would prove counter productive and would only encourage Pakistan and secessionist elements in the State.\\n\\nThey lambasted the Union Government and said that the manner in which the secessionist elements were facilitated to meet the Pakistan Foreign Minister is shameful. This smacks of a deep rooted conspiracy to undermine the position of the Indian nation and harm its vital national interests. The complicity of Pakistan in arranging meeting with these elements who are bent upon to break India has been established and as such the Government of India should have taken strong and appropriate measures, they added.\\n\\nInstead it seems that the meeting was facilitated by the Government and was held in full glare of the media.\\n\\nThey said it has shaken the nation and created doubts regarding the sincerity and credibility of the Government in context of Kashmir issue. The manner and conduct of the Government gives rise to fears and suspicions that there may be a sell out being worked out at the cost of the nationalist forces in the State.\\n\\nThey said that time and again, the nationalist forces in the country including the Kashmiri Pandits have made it clear that there is no constituency in the country for negotiating or experimenting over the territory and sovereignty of India in J&K. The KPs have asked the Government of India to initiate a comprehensive dialogue process with the representatives of the community that would ultimately lead to the establishment of a separate homeland for seven lakh KPs in Valley, the added.\\n\\nChief Executive Officer of the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB), has said that as per the Meteorological Department\\u2019s weather forecast for 30th July to 3rd August: there is a possibility of light rain/thundershowers on 30th \\u2013 31st July and it is expected to remain partly cloudy on 1st \\u2013 3rd August, 2011, in the Kashmir Division.\\n\\nThe CEO has yet again advised all those who intend to visit the Cave Shrine of Shri Amarnath to ascertain the obtaining weather conditions in the Amarnath Yatra area before embarking on the pilgrimage.

In addition, according to Millennium , the community huts appear to be new, and corn plantings were located, like thickets banana and peanuts.\\n\\nAmorim said that such discoveries require years of systematic and methodical, and documentary research, expeditions and satellite image analysis.\\n\\nBrazilian authorities want the tribe to continue alone, to avoid threats to native-like spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, the Brazilian government has banned contact with these tribes. Amorim says that the main threats to the integrity of these groups are fishing and illegal hunting, logging, mining, grazing and deforestation. The missionary activities and some border situations, such as drug trafficking and oil exploration, also pose a risk to these communities.\\n\\nThursday, July 28, 2011\\n\\nThe Agriculture department today organized a public awareness camp in Bhagwah area of Bhaderwah whereat AEO along with JAEOs and other subordinate staff apprised the farming community about various schemes and programmes being implemented by the department.\\n\\nNewly elected Sarpanchs and Panchs Lower Bhagwah, Manjmi and Mainchar of Panchayat and the general public participated in the awareness programme.

They also demanded traders list of PAK traders from PAK as the authorities did not provide the same to them.\\n\\nThe traders of both the sides expressed their satisfaction over the outcome of the talks and urged governments of India and Pakistan to increase the number of trading days and also increase the number of the trade items of the LoC trade.\\n\\nThe meeting was organised under the supervision of Abdul Hamid Custodian Cross LoC Trade and Kuldeep Raj TFO Poonch while Mirza Arshad Jaral ADC Tetrinote supervised traders meet from PAK side in the traders meet.\\n\\nA total of 105 traders including 49 from Indian side and 56 traders from PAK side participated in the traders meet.\\n\\nOfficial reports said that more than three traders settled their accounts which were pending from last more than one year.\\n\\nPak trader Choudary Mufti Basarat, Mohammad Hafiz, Mohammad Akbar, Zardar Abbassi, Mohammad Raza told KTNS there was need of trader to trader trade so that the middle man are shunt out from this Cross LoC trade.

He said that when he visited the school this afternoon he found only three teachers present there.\\n\\nThe \\\"feel good\\\" factor that Khar and Krishna laboured in their two-and-a-half hour talks to sustain optimism for continuing the talks was almost overturned by the acerbic Jethmalani.\\n\\nJust when everybody had finished the meals, he took the mike and praised former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. Not stopping at that, he then went on to attack China in the presence of Chinese ambassador Zhang Yan. He said China was an enemy of both countries and asked them to join and defeat the Beijing hegemony.\\n\\nAn embarrased High Commissioner Malik took mike from Jethmanali to clarify that these views were not shared by Pakistan.

Zhang was seated with the US charge d\\u2019 affairs Peter Burleigh.\\n\\nJethmalani even blushed the 34-year-old foreign minister of Pakistan, calling her charming lady.

The langer to the devotees was served by local army unit. Ravi Ji Bhat and Bharat Bhat of local Biradri also spoke on the occasion. A photo exhibition of Swami Jeewan Sahib a medieval period spiritual saint of Kashmir was also held at the shrine.\\n\\nAn increasing tourist rush in the valley is proving to be costlier for locals who wish to travel by air owing to an all time high air fares which on the other hand is not proving to be beneficial for the travel agents too.\\n\\nAir travel has jumped twice/ thrice of its original rates with a boost in the tourists influx. Subsequently, some locals who are not able to afford the air travel have to now travel by road as the prices of tickets are too high and the reservations are being made months before.\\n\\nMahipal Singh, a tourist told Kashmir Times, \\u201cI paid around Rs 40,000 from Chandigarh for a round trip for myself and three more family members. The prices are very high but we still managed to get a discount by the government agency office.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the valley based travel and tourism agents say that they have not been able to derive any benefits from air fare hike since the tourists get their tickets reserved from outside J&K which includes a two way trip.\\n\\n\\u201cPrices are going as high as Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 for a one way trip, and the lowest these days are around Rs 5,000,\\u201d said Nasir Khan, from Shiraz Travel agency\\u201cIts not proving beneficial for us since the tourist generally make a round trip reservation from outside, so more of tourists and hike in air tickets is doing us no good,\\u201d he added. However agreeing to the change of prices due to the inflow of tourists he also added that rise in prices also mean that the locals of Kashmir have to suffer since they can not afford such exorbitant prices for air tickets. In such cases they prefer traveling by other means of transport like by road or stopping halfway in Jammu and then further taking a train to Delhi.\\n\\n\\u201cThe traffic on the highway has increased over the months. One reason being it is the tourist season in Kashmir and other reason being the rise in prices of air ticket,\\u201d the tourism department officials said.\\n\\nA scholar at Kashmir University\\u2019s biochemistry department today alleged that he is being harassed by the authorities for seeking information under RTI.\\n\\nThe student, Arif Ahmad, alleged that he has been thrashed several times and was denied entry to the laboratory for seeking information about eligibility criteria for selection of Junior Research Fellow in the department of Immunology at SKIMS. The immunology department, Arif alleged, has selected an influential candidate in violation of the criteria.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter advertising the post, SKIMS selected an influential candidate. It was done in violation of the criteria so I submitted an application for information about selection process.\\n\\n\\u201cNext day, I was called to the department of biochemistry KU where three professors caged me in a room and in their presence the brother of the candidate beat me up. I was released only after I called the registrar,\\u201d Arif told Kashmir Times.\\n\\nArif said he was offered a monthly remuneration of Rs 18000 per month by the department for putting an end to the issue and for withdrawing the RTI application.\\n\\nHowever, according to Arif, he turned down the offer that prompted the authorities to deny him entry into the laboratory.\\n\\n\\u201cI wrote a letter to the registrar who referred it to the department. And surprisingly the department blamed me for not submitting the synopsis,\\u201d he alleged.\\n\\nThe blame forced the scholar to file an RTI application in the University seeking information about the number of scholars selected in the biochemistry department this year. But it landed him in more trouble, he said.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen I went to collect the information, I was told that it is incomplete. And they asked me to go to the HoD biochemistry\\u2019s office. But as I was leaving the office, chief proctor caught me from the neck and shoved me into his chamber.\\n\\n\\u201cThere he asked the female staff to leave and closed the door. Afterwards he and his uniformed men beat me up for about an hour. Finally they called the security officer and lied to him that I had assaulted the chief proctor,\\u201d Arif alleged. The scholar has submitted a complaint in the office of chief information commissioner who, according to the officials, has sent a show cause notice to the varsity authorities.\\n\\nHe has also sent a written application to the Superintendent of Police Hazratbal, but so for there has been no response.Arif alleged that the varsity officials are not allowing him to meet the vice chancellor while \\u201cthe police are also siding with the varsity.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe SP or the SHO are not responding to my complaint despite repeated pleas. I tried several times to meet the VC but the chief proctor and his allies have strictly instructed VC\\u2019s special secretary to prevent me from meeting him,\\u201d he alleged.\\n\\nArif said he is mulling to approach the State Human Rights Commission for justice in the case.\\n\\nWhen contacted, the registrar KU, Prof S Fayaz, termed issue as \\u201cscholar\\u2019s misgiving.\\u201d\\u201cSo far RTI is concerned, there is a proper procedure in place and we have no reason to deny information to anyone. Regarding the harassment allegations I do not think the university professors will harass or beat up anyone,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nCall it a total mismanagement of affairs or a half- hearted exercise of Board of School Education (BoSE) and Kashmir University, around 7000 students who took their Annual 12th class examinations (private) in March 2011 are being forced to waste one precious year of their academic session. It was BoSE which first delayed the conduct of examinations by at least three months and now Kashmir University which is not ready to take in these students to various colleges of the valley.\\n\\nInterestingly, the results of the 12th Annual Examinations were declared by BoSE on June 28, whereas the college admissions were closed on July 1. As such, students were left with just two days to get all the required documents and complete the formalities, which by no means were possible.\\n\\nStudents further alleged that the authorities in various colleges were admitting the regular candidates but when it came to private candidates, their applications were rejected at once.\\n\\nThis poses a serious threat to the careers of thousands of such students with another year being wasted from their academic session.\\n\\n\\u201cFor private candidates, this delay can turn out to be more serious as we have already a year\\u2019s gap and now one more year could jeopardize our careers,\\u201d Suhail, a student told Kashmir times.\\n\\nCaught in the middle of this official apathy, the students, who are running from pillar to post have been further insulted by Jammu and Kashmir Police, when they tried to meet authorities at Civil Secretariat, Srinagar on July 6.\\n\\nNot only did the policemen allegedly beat the students, they arrested several students including the girls and lodged them in the police station. However, this has barely brought down the enthusiasm among the students as their delegation told KTNS that nothing could come in their way of making sure that one year of academic session does not go waste.\\n\\nAt the expense of insensitivity of the authorities, students are being made to chase after University, college and administration officials.\\n\\nThousands of these students alleged that after Board of School Education (BoSE), it is now Kashmir University which instead of doing its job, is asking the students to seek admission from various colleges in the valley.\\n\\nInterestingly, the letter seeking the redress of students concerns written by Kashmir University to Commissioner Secretary Higher Education and Director Colleges according to students did not even reach there and it was only after student intervention that the matter was taken up before higher authorities.\\n\\n\\u201cInitially the delay in the conduct of examinations, then the delay in results by Board of School Education and now KU officials instead of taking care of the college admissions are dictating terms and asking us to approach colleges on an individual basis. If we would have relied on the words of University authorities, the process would have been completely halted,\\u201d Iqra, a grieved student asserted.\\n\\nThough students managed to reach out to the Principal, Gandhi Memorial College requesting him to spare some seats for them to which the latter consented, however the students allege that the University has been laidback in its approach in following up the case.\\n\\nPertinently, this serious matter has not even reached the offices of Commissioner Secretary Higher Education and Director Colleges even if the University officials claim to have written to them.\\n\\n\\u201cUniversity alone is not gong to solve this problem. The state government through the concerned authorities should direct the 36 colleges of the valley to makes some sort of arrangements for these thousands. We completely empathise with these students and do not want their precious years to go waste. However, we are already in the process of beginning new examination sessions and almost 40 percent of the syllabi has been completed. This is making their adjustment a little difficult. If the government gives a go ahead signal to the colleges to restart their sessions, University has no objections whatsoever,\\u201d Dr Nissar Mir, Deputy Registrar, Kashmir University said.\"\n
